The description of the parameters is provided in the paper and the instances. We only provide one matrix with the information for the distance and transportation times of trucks and workers. In these matrices, for the columns and rows, the first node corresponds to the depot, then the customer locations, and finally the parking sites. Therefore, the distances and transportation times between the depot and parking sites represent the values for trucks. Similarly, the distances and transportation times between the depot plus parking sites and customer locations represent the values for delivery workers.
