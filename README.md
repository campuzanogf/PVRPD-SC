# The Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Delivery Workers and Service Choice Instances

A repository with instances for the PVRPD-SC

The PVRPD-SC is an extension of the periodic vehicle routing problem with service choice (PVRP-SC) and the vehicle routing with multiple deliverymen (VRPMD). Therefore, the PVRPD-SC depicts a distribution system that indicates delivery routes for trucks and delivery workers, considering weekly distribution planning, capacitated vehicles, and work shifts. This repository contains instances for the PVRPD-SC to solve a real-case application for a food distribution company in Viña del Mar, Chile.

Comments within an instance's file start with /* and end with */ have to be ignored.
